# About Dead-hosts

[Dead-Hosts](https://github.com/dead-hosts) is the replacement of the original idea behind [funilrys/dead-hosts](https://github.com/funilrys/dead-hosts).

Indeed, the idea was to test - with the help of PyFunceble and Travis CI - hosts file, list of domains or even bocklist in order to have a list of active domains.

As [funilrys/dead-hosts](https://github.com/funilrys/dead-hosts) grew up it became impossible to have all those lists into one repository, that's why we use the GitHub organization system in order to create different repository for each list that has to be tested.
